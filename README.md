# Using-Git

It's about time I thoroughly learned how to use Git, so here's me messing about with it all to see what happens

Straight off the bat, I used `git clone` to clone this repository from the Github page to my directory. This sets it up as a remote repository since I didn't do `git init` on the local system.

Since updating this README, I'm going to commit it using `git add README.md`, then `git commit`.

`git commit` takes some options. Without any options, it'll open a file that allows you to write a commit message. You can also shortcut this using the `-m` option: `git commit -m <message>`
